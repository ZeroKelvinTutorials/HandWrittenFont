Things that can improve this tool:


Have Lines be child of an empty gameObject for ease of scaling them and moving them around

Set up horizontal limit to force new lines when text reaches a certain point

Set up TypeWriter and all together settings inside HandWrittenFont as options you can toggle in between.

Set up a way to add and/or change characters to the font.

Set up a way to save different fonts.

Set up a way to save/load drawings by detecting multi-character strings. example: "Square"

Set up a way to modify individual letters. 
Probably nest letters into empty GameObjects which themselves are children of an empty Gameobject. 
First nest deals with single-letter things like individual shake or positioning. 
Second Nest deals with full string things like Scaling, positioning, horizontal limits, etc.
